    <h1>Privacy Policy & Terms of Conditions</h1>
    <div class="meta">
        <strong>Whisper2Notes</strong><br>
        Effective Date: <em>[YYYY-MM-DD]</em>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Whisper2Notes is a <strong>100% offline speech-to-text application</strong> designed with privacy as a core principle.
        Your audio recordings and transcriptions <strong>never leave your device</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This page explains what data Whisper2Notes does (and does not) handle, how your data is stored, your responsibilities
        as a user, and important limitations related to device behavior.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Privacy Policy</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Data Collection</h3>
    <p>Whisper2Notes does <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or upload any personal data.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No audio recordings are uploaded</li>
        <li>No transcriptions are uploaded</li>
        <li>No analytics, tracking, or usage data is collected</li>
        <li>No accounts or logins are required</li>
        <li>No cloud services are used</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All processing happens locally on your device.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Audio Recording</h3>
    <p>
        Whisper2Notes uses your device’s microphone permission only when you explicitly start a recording.
        The app does not record audio in the background and does not access audio without your action.
    </p>

    <h3>2.3 Data Storage</h3>
    <p>
        All data is stored only on your device, including audio recordings, transcription text, and imported files.
        Whisper2Notes has no access to this data.
    </p>

    <h3>2.4 Data Deletion</h3>
    <div class="note">
        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong><br>
            If you delete the app, all recordings and transcriptions are permanently deleted.
            Whisper2Notes does not keep backups, and deleted data cannot be recovered.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>You are responsible for exporting or copying important notes regularly.</p>

    <h3>2.5 Third-Party Access</h3>
    <p>
        Whisper2Notes does not share data with third parties, does not use advertising SDKs,
        and does not integrate cloud AI services.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Terms & Conditions</h2>

    <h3>3.1 App Usage</h3>
    <p>
        By using Whisper2Notes, you agree to use the app for lawful purposes only
        and in accordance with these terms.
    </p>

    <h3>3.2 Offline Processing & System Limitations</h3>
    <p>
        Whisper2Notes relies on your device’s operating system and hardware.
        Due to system limitations:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Transcription runs only while the app is open and active</li>
        <li>Transcription may stop if you switch apps</li>
        <li>Transcription may stop if the screen turns off automatically</li>
        <li>Transcription may stop if you manually turn off the screen using the power button</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When this happens, return to Whisper2Notes and tap <strong>“Re-Transcribe”</strong> to continue.
        These behaviors are controlled by the operating system and are outside the app’s control.
    </p>

    <h3>3.3 Accuracy Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>
        Transcriptions are generated automatically and may contain errors.
        Accuracy depends on audio quality, language, accent, and device performance.
        Whisper2Notes does not guarantee transcription accuracy.
    </p>

    <h3>3.4 No Cloud Backup Responsibility</h3>
    <p>
        Whisper2Notes does not provide cloud storage or backups.
        Data loss may occur if the app is deleted, the device fails, or the device is reset.
        The developer is not responsible for lost or deleted data.
    </p>

    <h3>3.5 Importing Files</h3>
    <p>
        When importing audio or video files, you confirm that you have the legal right to use those files
        and that you comply with applicable copyright and local laws.
    </p>

    <h3>3.6 Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, Whisper2Notes is provided “as is.”
        The developer is not liable for data loss, transcription errors,
        or interruptions caused by system behavior.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy & Terms may be updated from time to time.
        Any updates will be reflected on this page with a revised effective date.
